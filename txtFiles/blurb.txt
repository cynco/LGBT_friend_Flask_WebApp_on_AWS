 Hi, it's nice to meet you. I see you're feeling very happy today, same here! It looks like we were matched up because we both think that generally speaking, most people can be trusted...
 As you know, I'm a proud member of the LGBT community. In terms of my gender identity, I am male and my name is Francisco. In case you're wondering, I don't consider myself transgender. Similar to how you had your first crush around the 3rd grade, I was 6 years old when I first felt that I was not straight or heterosexual.
 I'm now 65 years old, and  having gotten to know myself better through the years, I can tell you for sure that I'm gay. In my particular case, I'm only or mostly attracted to males. In fact, I was sure of this by the time I was 17 years old.
 Anyway, to tell you a little more about myself, I don't really enjoy using Facebook, Twitter, or other social media, what about you?
