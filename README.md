# LGBT_friend_Flask_WebApp_on_AWS

## **LGBT friend matcher**

A web app that polls the user and matches him/her with the anonymous profile of an actual US person 
who identifies as LGBT ad who was a respondent in the 2013 Pew Research survey on LGBT attitudes. 
The ‘friend’ profile is based on the respondent’s anonymous responses in the survey. 
The web app is hosted on an EC2 instance on AWS and uses the Flask framework. The purpose is to bring 
to life the survey responses and to provide a fun platform for people to explore the diversity of 
biological sex, sexual-orientation, and gender that exists.
